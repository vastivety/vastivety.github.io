            <p>Toolstack uses the device camera to identify and decode barcodes when the user permits the app to do so. If permission is denied, all other functionality provided by Toolstack is still available and the app can be used to identify and decode barcodes contained in images from device storage. Image data never leaves the app and is never stored. Decoded barcode contents are logged to an app-internal file to enable the use of a scan history. This history can be cleared at any time resulting in a deletion of all logged barcode contents.</p>
            <p>From time to time, when made necessary by changes introduced in an update of Toolstack, we will amend this policy. You are encouraged to review it periodically, especially after receiving an update to your installation of the app.</p>
